## Req 0.3.0

* Made URL parsing functions `parseUrlHttp` and `parseUrlHttps` recognize
  port numbers.

* Added `req'` function that allows to perform requests via a callback that
  receives pre-constructed request and manager.

* Removed the `ReturnRequest` HTTP response implementation as it was not
  quite safe and was not going to work with retrying. Use `req'` instead for
  “pure” testing.

* Changed the type of `httpConfigCheckResponse`, so the second argument can
  be any instance of `HttpResponse`.

* Added built-in automatic retrying. See `httpConfigRetryPolicy` and
  `httpConfigRetryJudge` in `HttpConfig`. The default configuration retries
  5 times on request timeouts.

* Added the `makeResponseBodyPreview` method to the `HttpResponse` type
  class that allows to specify how to build a “preview” of response body for
  inclusion into exceptions.

* Improved wording in the documentation and `README.md`.

## Req 0.2.0

* Added support for multipart form data in form of `ReqBodyMultipart` body
  option and `reqBodyMultipart` helper function. This also required a change
  in type signature of `getRequestContentType`, which now takes `body`, not
  `Proxy body` because we need to extract boundary from `body` and put it
  into `Content-Type` header. This change, however, shouldn't be too
  dangerous for end-users.

* Added support for OAuth 1.0 authentication via `oAuth1` option.

## Req 0.1.0

* Initial release.
